// We are going to learn about linked list.

// A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

// The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

// Each circle is a node of the linked list, and the number in it is the value of the node.

// The arrow shows the pointers which are used to link the nodes.

// The first node is called the head node, and the last node is called the tail node.
// The head node is the first node of the linked list.
// The tail node is the last node of the linked list.

// The Insertion and the Deletion are much easier than array.


// Inserion in a linked list is done in two ways:
// 1. Insertion at the beginning of the linked list
// 2. Insertion at the end of the linked list

// Deletion in a linked list is done in two ways:
// 1. Deletion at the beginning of the linked list
// 2. Deletion at the end of the linked list
